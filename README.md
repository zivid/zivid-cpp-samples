## Samples list

There are two main categories of samples: **Camera** and
**Applications**. The samples in the **Camera** category focus only on
how to use the camera. The samples in the **Applications** category use
the output generated by the camera, such as the 3D point cloud, a 2D
image or other data from the camera. These samples shows how the data
from the camera can be used.

## Installation

1.  [Install Zivid
    Software](https://support.zivid.com/latest//getting-started/software-installation.html)
2.  [Download Zivid Sample
    Data](https://support.zivid.com/latest//api-reference/samples/sample-data.html)

**Windows**

Launch the Command Prompt by pressing `Win` + `R` keys on the keyboard,
then type `cmd` and press `Enter`.

Navigate to a location where you want to clone the repository, then run
to following command:

``` sourceCode bat
git clone https://github.com/zivid/zivid-cpp-samples
```

Configure the sample solution with CMake, open it in Visual Studio,
build it, run it. For more information see [Configure C++ Samples With
CMake and Build Them in Visual Studio in
Windows](https://support.zivid.com/latest/api-reference/samples/cpp/configure-cpp-samples-with-cmake-and-build-them-in-visual-studio-on-windows.html).

**Ubuntu**

Open the Terminal by pressing `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `T` keys on the keyboard.

Navigate to a location where you want to clone the repository, then run
to following command:

``` sourceCode bash
git clone https://github.com/zivid/zivid-cpp-samples
cd zivid-cpp-samples
```

Build the project:

``` sourceCode bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake <options, see below> ../source
make -j
```

Some of the samples depend on external libraries, in particular Eigen 3,
OpenCV, PCL, or HALCON. If you don't want to install those, you can
disable the samples depending on them by passing the following options,
respectively, to `cmake`: `-DUSE_EIGEN3=OFF`, `-DUSE_OPENCV=OFF`,
`-DUSE_PCL=OFF`, `-DUSE_HALCON=OFF`.

If you do want to use them:

  - **Eigen 3**: Set `-DEIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR=<path>` where `<path>` is the
    root directory of your Eigen3 installation (the folder containing
    Eigen/Core, Eigen/Dense etc.)
  - **PCL** and **OpenCV**: If a recent enough version is installed on
    your system, these should just work. If not, set `-DPCL_DIR=<path>`
    / `-DOpenCV_DIR=<path>` where `<path>` is the directory containing
    `PCLConfig.cmake` and `OpenCVConfig.cmake`, respectively.
  - **HALCON**: If a recent enough version is installed on your system,
    these should just work.

The samples can now be run from the build directory, for instance like
this:

``` sourceCode bash
./CaptureFromFileCameraVis3D
```

### HALCON

If you want to use Zivid in HALCON, we provide a GenICam GenTL producer
that comes with the [Zivid Software](http://www.zivid.com/downloads).

Zivid and HALCON are compatible with Windows 10 and 11, and Ubuntu
20.04, 22.04, 24.04.

-----

Note:

> Support for Ubuntu 18.04 is removed since SDK 2.10.

-----

To setup and use Zivid in one of these operating systems, please follow
their respective instructions in the following pages:

  - [Install Zivid + HALCON for
    Windows](https://support.zivid.com/latest/api-reference/samples/halcon/install-zivid-halcon-for-windows.html)
  - [Install Zivid + HALCON for
    LINUX](https://support.zivid.com/latest/api-reference/samples/halcon/install-zivid-halcon-for-linux.html)
  - [Create a HALCON "Hello World"
    Program](https://support.zivid.com/latest/api-reference/samples/halcon/create-a-halcon-hello-world.html)
  - [How to Run a HALCON
    Sample](https://support.zivid.com/latest/api-reference/samples/halcon/how-to-run-a-halcon-sample.html)
  - [HALCON Sample
    Videos](https://support.zivid.com/latest/api-reference/samples/halcon/halcon-sample-videos.html)

The following HALCON versions have been tested and confirmed to work
with Zivid cameras:

  - 19.05 Progress, 20.05 Progress, 21.11 Progress

We recommend to use one of the HALCON versions we have tested.

## Support

For more information about the Zivid cameras, please visit our
[Knowledge Base](https://support.zivid.com/latest). If you run into any
issues please check out
[Troubleshooting](https://support.zivid.com/latest/support/troubleshooting.html).

## License

Zivid Samples are distributed under the [BSD
license](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-cpp-samples/tree/master/LICENSE).

## Development

To run continuous integration locally, use
[Docker](https://www.docker.com). With Docker installed, run this
command:

``` sourceCode bash
docker run -it -v <unix-style-repo-path>:/host -w /host/continuous-integration/linux ubuntu:20.04
```

Where `<unix-style-repo-path>` is the unix-style path to the repo on
your computer. On Linux, use `$PWD` for this. On Windows you need to
translate the windows-style path to a unix-style one (e.g.
`/c/Users/alice/Documents/zivid-cpp-samples`).

Now run `./setup.sh` to install dependencies. Once setup has completed,
you can run `./lint.sh && ./build.sh` repeatedly to check your code.

-----

Tip:

If your build hangs, try to increase the memory available to Docker.
